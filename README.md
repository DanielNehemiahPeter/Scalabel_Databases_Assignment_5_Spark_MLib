Step 1: We have fetched the live data of the stock price of Amazon company by using the api_key method with the help of spark method coding
Step2: We checked if the data was loaded correctly
step3: We performed data cleaning and data type transformation
step4: We conducted Exploratory data analysis to understand the data better by using different methods
step 5: We install pyspark and java jdk to build the Apache Spark app 
Step 6: We built StockDataApp
Step 7: We loaded the dataframe into the app to perform Window Operations for time based data aggrefations
Step 8: We performed Machine Learning model build 
Step 9:we splitted the data into 70/30 , train and test datasets
Step 10: We used rmse, r2, and r2_squared values to check the performance of the dataset
model was built with 98.85 ~ 99% confidence so their is no need to optimize the model
